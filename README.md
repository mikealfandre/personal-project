## +GIVEWYSE.

+GIVEWYSE. is a personal app that I developed. It is a way for people to discover and donate to charities. I used **Node.js** and Axios to create the server and make all of my database and authorization (Login, Register) API requests.

I also use Axios to make RESTful API HTTP requests from two 3rd party APIs. The first API is CharityNavigator.org, which has detailed information about every registered non-profit in the United States. The second API is Unsplash.com; this is where all the images come from.

You can see the code I wrote to build the server using Node in the **server** folder. In that folder, you will see the **index.js** where I run the server and the two controller files that contain the logic to the API requests.

To see some examples of how I make client side requests to the API's navigate the following way: **src** > **components** > **Home** > **Home.js**   



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
