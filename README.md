## +GIVEWYSE.

+GIVEWYSE. is a personal app that I developed. It is a way for people to discover and donate to charities. I used Node.js to create the server and Axios to make RESTful API requests from two 3rd party APIs. The first API is CharityNavigator.org, which has detailed information about every registered non-profit in the United States. The second API is Unsplash.com; this is where all the images come from. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
